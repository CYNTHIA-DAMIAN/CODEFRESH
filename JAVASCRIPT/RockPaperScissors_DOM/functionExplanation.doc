ALL THIS BELOW WAS EXPLAINED BY AI AND I AM KEEPING IT FOR FUTURE REFERENCES:

Exactly! Let's break it down even further in simpler terms.

### How `hasPlayerWonTheRound` Works

1. **Fetching Values:**
   - When you call `hasPlayerWonTheRound(userOption, computerResult)`, you pass two values (called arguments) to the function: `userOption` and `computerResult`.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The function `hasPlayerWonTheRound` uses these values to check if the player's choice beats the computer's choice.

### Detailed Example

1. **Player Makes a Choice:**
   - Suppose the player chooses "Rock". This value is stored in `userOption`.

2. **Computer Makes a Choice:**
   - The computer randomly picks "Scissors". This value is stored in `computerResult`.

3. **Calling the Function:**
   - You call the function: `hasPlayerWonTheRound(userOption, computerResult)`.
   - In this case, itâ€™s the same as calling: `hasPlayerWonTheRound("Rock", "Scissors")`.

4. **Function Execution:**
   ```javascript
   function hasPlayerWonTheRound(player, computer) {
     return (
       (player === "Rock" && computer === "Scissors") ||
       (player === "Scissors" && computer === "Paper") ||
       (player === "Paper" && computer === "Rock")
     );
   }
   ```
   - The function receives `player = "Rock"` and `computer = "Scissors"`.
   - It checks three conditions to determine if the player wins:
     1. `player === "Rock" && computer === "Scissors"` (true in this case, because "Rock" beats "Scissors").
     2. `player === "Scissors" && computer === "Paper"` (not checked because the first condition is true).
     3. `player === "Paper" && computer === "Rock"` (not checked because the first condition is true).

5. **Returning the Result:**
   - Since the first condition is true, the function returns `true`, indicating that the player wins this round.

### How the Result is Used in `getRoundResults`

1. **Calling `getRoundResults`:**
   ```javascript
   function getRoundResults(userOption) {
     const computerResult = getRandomComputerResult();
     if (hasPlayerWonTheRound(userOption, computerResult)) {
       playerScore++;
       return `Player wins! ${userOption} beats ${computerResult}`;
     } else if (computerResult === userOption) {
       return `It's a tie! Both chose ${userOption}`;
     } else {
       computerScore++;
       return `Computer wins! ${computerResult} beats ${userOption}`;
     }
   }
   ```
   
2. **Function Execution:**
   - The `getRoundResults` function calls `getRandomComputerResult()` to get a random move for the computer and stores it in `computerResult`.
   - Then it calls `hasPlayerWonTheRound(userOption, computerResult)` to check if the player wins.

3. **Handling the Result:**
   - If `hasPlayerWonTheRound` returns `true`, it increments `playerScore` and returns a message saying the player wins.
   - If the player and computer chose the same move, it returns a message saying it's a tie.
   - If neither condition is true, it means the computer wins, so it increments `computerScore` and returns a message saying the computer wins.
